Hi there! My name is Chlo√© Ostermann and I am currently majoring in Environmental Studies (B.S.) with a minor in Architecture and Urban History. Having taken a wide array of classes at UCSB, I have pinpointed that I am interested in topics of Sustainability, Renewable Energy, and Environmental Engineering.

# Hobbies & Excursions

During my free time, I enjoy learning new crafts and going on excursions with friends. Most recently, I learned how to knit using circular knitting needles and have been working on a boat-neck top. I also taught myself to crochet articles of clothing like a skirt, a shawl, and two tops.

Having grown up in a very sports-centered family, I also find ways to incorporate sports and excursions into my schedule.

# Meet my kitties! 

My cats mean the world to me and have been a constant source of comfort so I figured they deserve a place on this page about me.

On the left is **Sundae**, also called Sunny, who is the sweetest most harmless cat I know. Very cuddly and smart, she is slightly more reserved than her brother but very curious and lovable. When she's not napping, she enjoys trying to fit into the smallest most dispoportionate boxes and climbing shelves. She also seriously loves to eat cheese and strawberries.

On the right, **Orbit** is just a big chunky ball of fluff and fun. He reminds me of a cuddly teddy bear with the way he lets you flop him around when he is ready for nap time (which they both take very seriously). He is very food motivated, playful, and often gets into trouble for jumping on the counter and eating flowers.

Even when I can't see them due to the distance from college, I love to look look at pictures of them in my camera roll (which has to be more than 50% cat pictures). In fact, it was very difficult choosing the right picture for each of them on this page.
