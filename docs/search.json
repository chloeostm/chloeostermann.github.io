    "text": "In March of 2024, I had the opportunity to take the class ES 40 with Professor Jen Martin. In this class, we explored how to exercise critical thinking when navigating the web and any resources we might use in our future professional careers.\nThe capstone assignment for this class was to develop a creative project on any subject we might be interested in. I picked the topic of bio-mimicry having heard of it in high school and being mesmerized by how intricately designed nature is and how applicable its elements can be to human designs.\nI opted for the topic of bio mimicry in architecture by giving the example of naturally insulated buildings inspired by termitarys (termite nests). To display all of my finding on this topic, I decided to create a zine on Canva.\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{ostermann2025,\n  author = {Ostermann, Chloe},\n  title = {Biomimicry in {Architecture}},\n  date = {2025-06-03},\n  url = {https://chloeostermann.github.io/posts/20250601_post2_biomimicry/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nOstermann, Chloe. 2025. “Biomimicry in Architecture.” June\n3, 2025. https://chloeostermann.github.io/posts/20250601_post2_biomimicry/."

    "text": "Hi there! My name is Chloé Ostermann and I am currently majoring in Environmental Studies (B.S.) with a minor in Architecture and Urban History. Having taken a wide array of classes at UCSB, I have pinpointed that I am interested in topics of Sustainability, Renewable Energy, and Environmental Engineering.\n\n\nHobbies & Excursions\nDuring my free time, I enjoy learning new crafts and going on excursions with friends. Most recently, I learned how to knit using circular knitting needles and have been working on a boat-neck top. I also taught myself to crochet articles of clothing like a skirt, a shawl, and two tops.\nHaving grown up in a very sports-centered family, I also find ways to incorporate sports and excursions into my schedule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet my kitties!\nMy cats mean the world to me and have been a constant source of comfort so I figured they deserve a place on this page about me.\nOn the left is Sundae, also called Sunny, who is the sweetest most harmless cat I know. Very cuddly and smart, she is slightly more reserved than her brother but very curious and lovable. When she’s not napping, she enjoys trying to fit into the smallest most dispoportionate boxes and climbing shelves. She also seriously loves to eat cheese and strawberries.\nOn the right, Orbit is just a big chunky ball of fluff and fun. He reminds me of a cuddly teddy bear with the way he lets you flop him around when he is ready for nap time (which they both take very seriously). He is very food motivated, playful, and often gets into trouble for jumping on the counter and eating flowers.\nEven when I can’t see them due to the distance from college, I love to look look at pictures of them in my camera roll (which has to be more than 50% cat pictures). In fact, it was very difficult choosing the right picture for each of them on this page."
