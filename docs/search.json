This graph represents data I collected over multiple weeks where I recorded the hours of sleep I got in one day and which transportation mode I used earlier in the day (walking, biking or taking the bus) to determine whether mode of transportation affects my sleep. I opted for a boxplot and seperate colors to better organize the three groups of transportation.

    "text": "In March of 2024, I had the opportunity to take the class ES 40 with Professor Jen Martin. In this class, we explored how to exercise critical thinking when navigating the web and any resources we might use in our future professional careers.\nThe capstone assignment for this class was to develop a creative project on any subject we might be interested in. I picked the topic of bio-mimicry having heard of it in high school and being mesmerized by how intricately designed nature is and how applicable its elements can be to human designs.\nI opted for the topic of bio mimicry in architecture by giving the example of naturally insulated buildings inspired by termitarys (termite nests). To display all of my finding on this topic, I decided to create a zine on Canva.\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{ostermann2025,\n  author = {Ostermann, Chloe},\n  title = {Biomimicry in {Architecture}},\n  date = {2025-06-03},\n  url = {https://chloeostermann.github.io/posts/20250601_post2_biomimicry/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nOstermann, Chloe. 2025. “Biomimicry in Architecture.” June\n3, 2025. https://chloeostermann.github.io/posts/20250601_post2_biomimicry/."

    "text": "Hi there! My name is Chloé Ostermann and I am currently majoring in Environmental Studies (B.S.) with a minor in Architecture and Urban History. Having taken a wide array of classes at UCSB, I have pinpointed that I am interested in topics of Sustainability, Renewable Energy, and Environmental Engineering.\n\n\nTraveling\nOne thing about me is I love to travel and explore new places. I am lucky enough to be apart of a French American family so I got the chance to travel to France for during summer breaks almost every year since I was 4. My grandmother would take care of my brother and I for a month or two and keep us occupied with daily hikes in the mountains and other various activities. Besides trips to France to visit family, I’ve had the chance to explore other countries worldwide with my parents and brother, and learn about various cultures, traditions, and lifestyles. To see some of the countries I’ve been to, the map below shows what countries I’ve visited.\n\nlibrary(leaflet) \nlibrary(tibble)\n\ncities &lt;- tibble( name = c(\"San Francisco\", \"Paris\", \"Montreal\", \"Madrid\", \"Hanoi\", \"Tahiti\", \"Cape Town\"), lat = c(37.7602523640256, 48.86198773083308, 45.50566793423559, 40.415765578600706, 21.034791719384796, -17.543761791615648, -33.9255539018927), lng = c(-122.42681736086065, 2.294159806953058, -73.5819271670175, -3.7063982175738746, 105.8347141261459, -149.83170940623626, 18.43387871377049) )\n\nleaflet(data = cities) %&gt;% \n  addTiles() %&gt;% \n  addAwesomeMarkers(~lng, ~lat, popup = ~name, icon = awesomeIcons( icon = \"globe\", iconColor = \"black\", markerColor = \"green\", library = \"fa\" ))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHobbies & Excursions\nDuring my free time, I enjoy learning new crafts and going on excursions with friends. Most recently, I learned how to knit using circular knitting needles and have been working on a boat-neck top. I also taught myself to crochet articles of clothing like a skirt, a shawl, and two tops.\nHaving grown up in a very sports-centered family, I also find ways to incorporate sports and excursions into my schedule. I like to go sunset jogging and doing Pilates with friends whenever possible. I have also been going to the UCSB rec center to boulder at their rock climbing gym which has been giving me the best rounded workout.\nI also joined UCSB’s Excursion Club with whom I’ve been skiing, stand-up paddling, surfing, and hiking.\nHiking around Santa Barbara and beyond has brought me the most rewarding sights. Every weekend I try and explore a new path I have not taken before and it always brings me to beautiful views full of new flowers, streams, and plants. So far, my favorites have been tangerine Falls, and the hot and cold spring trails. Below are some pictures I took on some hikes I have been on recently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTangerine Falls, SB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTangerine Falls Trail, SB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuir Woods National Park\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJesusita Trail, SB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet my kitties!\nMy cats mean the world to me and have been a constant source of comfort so I figured they deserve a place on this page about me.\nOn the left is Sundae, also called Sunny, who is the sweetest most harmless cat I know. Very cuddly and smart, she is slightly more reserved than her brother but very curious and lovable. When she’s not napping, she enjoys trying to fit into the smallest most dispoportionate boxes and climbing shelves. She also seriously loves to eat cheese and strawberries.\nOn the right, Orbit is just a big chunky ball of fluff and fun. He reminds me of a cuddly teddy bear with the way he lets you flop him around when he is ready for nap time (which they both take very seriously). He is very food motivated, playful, and often gets into trouble for jumping on the counter and eating flowers.\nEven when I can’t see them due to the distance from college, I love to look look at pictures of them in my camera roll (which has to be more than 50% cat pictures). In fact, it was very difficult choosing the right picture for each of them on this page."
