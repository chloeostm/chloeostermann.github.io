    "text": "In March of 2024, I had the opportunity to take the class ES 40 with Professor Jen Martin. In this class, we explored how to exercise critical thinking when navigating the web and any resources we might use in our future professional careers.\nThe capstone assignment for this class was to develop a creative project on any subject we might be interested in. I picked the topic of bio-mimicry having heard of it in high school and being mesmerized by how intricately designed nature is and how applicable its elements can be to human designs.\nI opted for the topic of bio mimicry in architecture by giving the example of naturally insulated buildings inspired by termitarys (termite nests). To display all of my finding on this topic, I decided to create a zine on Canva.\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{ostermann2025,\n  author = {Ostermann, Chloe},\n  title = {Biomimicry in {Architecture}},\n  date = {2025-06-03},\n  url = {https://chloeostermann.github.io/posts/20250601_post2_biomimicry/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nOstermann, Chloe. 2025. “Biomimicry in Architecture.” June\n3, 2025. https://chloeostermann.github.io/posts/20250601_post2_biomimicry/."

On the left is Sundae, also called Sunny, who is the sweetest cat I know. Very cuddly and smart, she is slightly more shy than her brother and seriously loves to eat cheese and strawberries.\nOn the right, Orbit is just a big chunky ball of fluff and fun. He reminds me of a cuddly teddy bear the way he lets you flop him around when he is ready for nap time (which they both take very seriously). He is very food motivated, playful, and often gets into trouble for jumping on the counter and eating flowers.\nEven when I can’t see them due to the distance from college, I love to look look at pictures of them in my camera roll (which has to be more than 50% cat pictures). In fact, it was very difficult choosing the right picture for each of them on this page."
