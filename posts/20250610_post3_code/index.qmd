Below is a snipet of code from Homework 3 from ES 193DS. This graph represents data I collected over multiple weeks where I recorded the hours of sleep I got in one day and which transportation mode I used earlier in the day (walking, biking or taking the bus) to determine whether mode of transportation affects my sleep. I opted for a boxplot and seperate colors to better organize the three groups of transportation. Thanks to this visualization, I could better interpret my data and notice that I tend to sleep more on days where I walk (where I hit the highest Ymax) and the least when I take the bus. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(here)
library(readxl)

my_data <- read_xlsx(here("files","ES193DS_personal_data.xlsx"), sheet = "Sheet1") 
# read in data
my_data_clean <- my_data %>% 
  clean_names() # clean data

ggplot(data = my_data_clean, 
       aes(x = transportation_mode, # x-axis
           y = sleep_hrs, # y-axis
           color = transportation_mode)) + # fill geoms by transportation mode
  
  geom_boxplot(color = "darkgrey") + # create boxplots
  
  geom_jitter(height = 0, # create jitter points size, width, and opacity
              width = 0.1,
              size = 2,
              alpha = 0.6) + # data points set to 60% opacity
  
  scale_color_manual(values = c("firebrick4", "orange", "forestgreen")) + 
  # set custom colors
  
  theme_minimal() + # minimal theme
  labs(title = str_wrap("Boxplot comparing hours of sleep versus 
                        mode of transportation used in a day", width = 60),  # set title
       #wrap title so it doesn't get cut off
       x = "Mode of transportation", # title x axis
       y = "Hours slept") + # title y axis
  
  theme(legend.position = "none") + # take out the legend
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + # center the title
  theme(panel.border = element_rect(color = "darkgrey", fill = NA, linewidth = 1)) # keep panel border


```
